The C++ Machine project is a basic command-line calculator designed to handle various mathematical operations. It allows users to perform standard operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as more advanced functionalities such as trigonometric operations (e.g., sin, cos), handling negative values, and more.

Key features include:

    Tokenization: Breaking down mathematical expressions into individual tokens for parsing.
    Mathematical Operations: Handling common arithmetic operations, including edge cases like negative numbers.
    Error Handling: Ensuring that invalid inputs (e.g., division by zero) or malformed expressions are gracefully handled.
    Trigonometric Functions: Support for trigonometric operations, like sin and cos, where negative numbers are correctly processed.
